# Indoor communication via Li-Fi - Project 2nd year 2023/24
Use Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) technology to establish wireless communication between a transmitter equipped with LEDs and a photosensitive receiver.
Unlike infrared technologies, which are subject to interference, our application uses visible light to transmit data quickly and efficiently.

## Equipment used
- 2 Arduino Nano 33 IoT boards
- an electronic board equipped with 6 LEDs (sender)
- an electronic board equipped with a photosensitive sensor (receiver)

## Git repository description
In this Git repository you will find :
- the KiCad files for the PCB used to receive the light signals,
- the codes to be implemented on the Arduino boards in order to send, receive and process the light signals.

## Students in charge of the project
- GAMIETTE David

## Teachers supervising the project
- DUMAS Jean-Michel
